# MySimpleNote

This is a basic web-based note application. I made this project when I was in college; it has basic CRUD features and a very bad authentication system. What can I say? I was a student who had just learned web development back then. The app was made with PHP and MySQL for the database. I may or may not revisit this later. I put this project here so that my github page does not look too empty.Â
